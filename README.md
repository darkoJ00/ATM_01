# ATM_01
ATM machine simulation using txt files to store data and read data,
Simulator has a controlled user input, including login check, command check, input transaction value check.
Idea can be expanded to feature connection to database instead of text files.
Concept could also be implemented and further upgraded/adapted for web applications (online transactions), using forms... MVC... and database connection and ect...
